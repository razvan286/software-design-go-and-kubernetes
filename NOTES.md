# Notes

## Go Scheduler

Go Scheduler converts I/O bound workloads into CPU bound workloads. We never want more threads than cores.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means that a piece of code is changing its behavior depending upon the concrete data it is operating on.

## Building trust through system layers and data integrity

Build the data flow trust through type systems and data shaping.
